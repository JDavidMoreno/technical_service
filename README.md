## Motivation

I made this module almost three years ago, and at that time I'm not really sure if the main Odoo's Technical Service addon existed or not. The idea came up while discussing with the CEO of one IT company at my city, they had (and still have) their own management software, but were insterested in a solucion specifically for the Tecnical Service field. At that time I was learning Odoo so I took the idea and tried as best as possible to develop it.

## Installation

Move this module to your addons folder. Then restart your Odoo server and, while in developer mode, click the button Update Apps List from the Apps addons.

## Usage

One instaled, you can go the Technical Service app, that should appear as a new addon. From there you can start creating new request, add all the info you need, and move to next stages when needed.

At different stages for the request, different kinf of information can be entered. When you know how much time and resources you spent in your services, you can add it there, and finally you can create a Invoice for it.

Also is possible to organise the work with teams.

And create and edit the kind of devices you'r going to work with.
